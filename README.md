# Multiple_levels_of_encryption
 Give me a string and I will make sure nobody will be able to read it
 
 * Add the text you want to be encrypted:

 * Once the text is introduced, you need to press enter in order to view the encryption:

 * The first level is making an inversion of the characters introduced
 * The second level is inversing one random  character with other random character for a random number of times (in this case it has been made 6 times)
 * The third level is taking every character from the text and depending on the type (upper/lower case/others), is shifting the characters with a specific number to the right/left.
 * The fourth level creates a matrix with special characters
 * The fifth level (and the final) converts every character from the matrix into binary
